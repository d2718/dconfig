# dconfig
A Go package for reading unix configuration files of the `OPTION=value` format.

I use this package in many of my programs.

I think the best instruction I can give for how to use the package is just
to look at the `example/example.go` (and its accompanying
`example/example.conf`), for an example, and then take a peek at the source
if you're looking for specifics. I realize this sounds like a cop-out, but
it's a simple, straightforward package.
